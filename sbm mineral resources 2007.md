Working Paper: CONFLICT MINERALS IN THE CONGO: mainly due to economic factors.The Congo supposedly possesses every natural mineral in the periodic table of elements,and so the resource curse strikes again9.The DRC contains about $24 trillion dollars worth of valuable minerals,such as coltan,gold,diamonds,tin,uranium,etc.10 This equals the combined GDP of Europe and the United States11. Preliminary Assessment of NonFuel Mineral Resources of Mineral resources are materials that are in such form that economic extraction of a commodity is currently or potentially feasible.In this assessment,teams of scientists from the USGS and the AGS compiled information about known mineral deposits and then evaluated the possible occurrence of undiscovered deposits of all types. Mineral Resources Program usgs.gov The USGS Mineral Resources Program (MRP) delivers unbiased science and information to increase understanding of ore formation,undiscovered mineral resource potential,production,consumption,and how minerals interact with the environment.
