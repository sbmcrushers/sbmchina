Pretreatment Process on Refractory Gold Ores with As Gold ores are considered refractory if gold extractions from a conventional cyanidation process are less than 80% even after fine grinding.1) Arsenic bearing refractory gold ore has stones extremely difficult to deal with.In the stones,gold is locked up in arsenic mineral matrix as the form of microscopic or submicroscopic lattice. Chemical Used in Gold Mining Chemical Used in Gold Mining Refractory Gold Ores.The gold also occurs as sub microscopic particles in sulphides or as absorbed gold onto surfaces of carbonaceous matter.Because of the variation of these refractory ores,gold occurrence is ore specific and before process decisions are made,competent mineralogical and metallurgical evaluation must be carried before final process decisions. Advances in high temperature heap leaching of refractory. 13&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;and refractory ores,as well as smaller deposits.As a result,the level of sophistication that needs to be built into the design and operation of the heap leaching process also increases.The heap leaching of copper ores is an example of such a trend,where heap leaching was initially applied only to the acid leaching of oxide ores. US6251163B1 Method for recovering gold from refractory, The process of the present invention recovers precious metals from refractory carbonaceous precious metal ores by floating a portion of the ground ore,blending the concentrate with an unfloated portion of the ore,autogenously autoclaving the blended material,cooling the oxidized slurry by dilution,leaching the oxidized slurry after, Biooxidation BioMineWiki In the biooxidation process,bacteria partially oxidize the sulfide coating covering the gold microparticles in ores and concentrat In this way,gold recovery from refractory minerals can increase from 15 30% to 85 95% Supercritical Water Treatment of Refractory Gold Ores Supercritical water pretreatment of refractory carbonaceous gold ores did not achieve the desired improvements in gold recovery.The concept of liquefaction to deactivate the carbonaceous absorbent in gold ores appeared to have merit,however.
