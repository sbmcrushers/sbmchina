What Is Alluvial Gold? Alluvial is a term that refers to soil sediments and the various sand,silt,gravel,clay or other deposited matter left behind by flowing water.“Alluvial gold” refers to the type of gold dust found in that kind of soil.When the beds of rivers or streams are scooped and panned for gold dust,the product is referred to as alluvial gold. The Gold Smelting Process Many people confuse gold smelting with melting.Whereas gold melting is simply heating gold to turn into a liquid form before forming gold bars,smelting is a more complex process that involves the removal of impurities from gold using heat,pressure and a number of chemicals.History of Gold Smelting.The smelting of gold is not a new process. How gold is extracted from its alluvial gravel The word Alluvial describes a type of soil.It can be made up of sand,silt,clay,gravel,or other matter deposited by flowing water.Alluvial Mining is when a prospector gets the gold bearing. Gold Refining Process 2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The gold occurring in the alluvium is not refined by any of Nature’s processes—but the accompanying minerals or metals are either oxidised or removed hence,in the recovery of gold from reefs impurities are often collected and introduced,thus making it of lower value than the corresponding alluvial gold,and also giving rise to erroneous.
