How to Increase Germanium Extraction from Zinc 20191013&ensp&#0183&enspGermanium is produced almost exclusively from waste residue of hydrometallurgical zinc processing operations (Llewellyn,1989).Currently,highgrade domestic zinc residues containing enough germanium to supply the annual needs of the U.S.are processed in foreign countries by proprietary techniques to recover the germanium (Plunkert,1985). Difference in Dissolution Between Germanium and Zinc The difference in dissolution between germanium and zinc during oxidative pressure leaching of germaniumbearing sphalerite was evaluated in laboratoryscale experiments.

Behaviors of gallium and germanium associated with zinc 201757&ensp&#0183&ensptraditional roastleachelectrowinning process of zinc hydrometallurgy,Ga and Ge can only be retrieved from these zinc sulfide concentrates with low rates of recovery and significantly high costs.Development of oxygen pressure leaching provides a more efficient way to extract germanium and gallium from a zinc sulfide concentrate. Zinc Ore an overview ScienceDirect Topics Gold recovery from copper zinc ores is usually higher than that obtained from either a lead zinc or copper lead zinc ore.This is attributed to two main factors.When selecting a reagent scheme for treatment of copper zinc ores,there are more choices than for the other ore types,which can lead to the selection of a reagent scheme which is more favourable for gold flotation. The Extraction of Gallium from Zinc Ores CaltechTHESIS The discovery of small amounts of gallium in zinc ores showed the possibility of its presence in a small quantity of zinc ore residues on hand at the Institute.Germanium had been previously extracted from the ore,and later,part of the zinc was recovered.During this work,the presence of gallium was shown by spectroscopic tests,and indium was at the same time shown to be absent.&lt p&gt &ltp&gtIn Minerals Free FullText Characterization of Germanium 201721&ensp&#0183&enspThe first two,the most prevalent,show germanium (II) and (IV) surrounded by sulphur atoms in tetrahedral coordination,suggesting the replacement of Zn by Ge.In the third configuration,germanium (IV) is surrounded by oxygen atoms.This third configuration is unexpected for a zinc sulphide mineral and it resembles that of argutite (GeO2). Commodity profile ZINC British Geological Survey Commodity profile ZINC Zinc,chemical symbol Zn,is a lustrous bluishwhite metal.It is mainly used in galvanising steel to prevent rusting,in zinc diecasting alloys and in copperbased alloys,such as brass.Zinc is also essential to the growth of many kinds of organisms,both plant and animal.It is a relatively rare element in the Earth's
