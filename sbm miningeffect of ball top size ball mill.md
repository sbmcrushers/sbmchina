Calculation of Top Grinding Media Size Ball Sizing The majority of grinding balls are forged carbon or alloy steels.Generally,they are spherical,but other shapes have been used.The choice of the top (or recharge) ball size can be made using empirical equations developed by Bond (1958) or Azzaroni (1984) or by using special batch grinding tests interpreted i effect of ball top size ball mill Ball mill Wikipedia.A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind,blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as effect of ball top size ball mill Ball mills are used for grinding things down or for mixing things up.the material is poured into the top and the cap is replaced,like a kitchen blender.Like all ball mills,the speed and ball size have an effect on how the vertical ball mill works.Get Price ball mill feed top size Ball top size diameter calculation Db = the top size of the grinding media in mm.Pf = size in &#181; of the 80% passing in the fresh feed.C = 200 for ball mills an Calculate and Select Ball Mill Ball Size for Optimum Grinding Often,the ball used in ball mills is oversize “just in case”.Well,this safety factor can cost you much in recovery and or mill liner wear and tear.Here is your Ball Mill Design Sizing Procedure.Calculation of top size grinding media (Fred C.Bond) Calculation of Ball Mill VS Rod Mill After long time grinding,the material be grinded to the correct size.For details,the grinding theory of ball mill and rod are different in many ways.For ball mill,the grinding force of steel ball to ore is less than the impact,because the contact area is small between balls and mineral. Grinding Balls &amp; Rods These balls may be had in two types: a soft ball Brinnell 450+ for large diameter ball mills,and a hard ball Brinnell 600+ for small ball mills.The addition of molybdenum,chromium and manganese provides an excellent microstructure for these grinding balls.Balls are available in 4″,3&#189; Ball mills With more than 100 years of experience in ball mill technology,Metso’s ball mills are designed for long life and minimum maintenance.They grind ores and other materials typically to 35 mesh or finer in a variety of applications,both in open or closed circuits.
