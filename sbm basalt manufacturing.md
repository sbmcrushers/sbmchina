sbm basalt manufacturingBasalt fiber Wikipedia Basalt fiber is a material made from extremely fine fibers of basalt,which is composed of the minerals plagioclase,pyroxene,and olivine.It is similar to fiberglass,having better physicomechanical properties than fiberglass,but being significantly cheaper than carbon fiber. What is Basalt Fiber 28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Crushed basalt rock is the only raw material required for manufacturing the fiber.It is a continuous fiber produced through igneous basalt rock melt drawing at about 2,700&#176; F (1,500&#176; C).Though the temperature required to produce fibers from basalt is higher than glass,it is reported by some researchers that production of fibers made from basalt requires less energy by due to the uniformity.
