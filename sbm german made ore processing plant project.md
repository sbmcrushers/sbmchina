Bleiwas,D.I.2011,Estimates of electricity requirements for the recovery of mineral commodities,with examples applied to sub Saharan Africa: U.S.Geological Survey Open File Report 2011 1253,100 p. Lead smelting Wikipedia Plants for the production of lead are generally referred to as lead smelters.Primary lead production begins with sintering.Concentrated lead ore is fed into a sintering machine with iron,silica,limestone fluxes,coke,soda ash,pyrite,zinc,caustics or pollution control particulates.Smelting uses suitable reducing substances that will combine with those oxidizing elements to free the metal. Ore processing Waihi Gold Ore processing is a 24 hour operation.Ore is stockpiled (1) at the processing plant,and the process begins by feeding the ore into a hopper with a loader.The ore is conveyed,and lime is added (2) to raise the pH of the ore.Following crushing through a jaw crusher (3),the ore is fed into the semi autogenous grinding (SAG) mill (4) along.
