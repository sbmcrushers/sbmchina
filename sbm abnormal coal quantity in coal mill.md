Coal Coal is a combustible black or brownish black sedimentary rock,formed as rock strata called coal seams.Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements; chiefly hydrogen,sulfur,oxygen,and nitrogen.[1] Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over. Review of control and fault diagnosis. Coal mills or pulverizers play a very essential part in the coal fired power production system.Coal mills grind the coal into fine powder,and the primary air entering the mill dries and drives the coal into the power plant furnace for combustion.Mills can be a bottleneck for the power generation process.
