Glossary Archaeological Institute of America Glossary on the AIA website.Datum point A specific,fixed loion from which all measurements on a site are made or to which they are calibrated.See Benchmark.Debitage Small pieces of stone debris that break off during the manufacturing of stone tools.These are usually considered waste and are a byproduct of production. Living by the shore: Mesolithic dwellings and in Living by the shore: Mesolithic dwellings and in Motala,eastern central Sweden,5600 5000 cal BC We present structural elements as well as utilized lithics,firewood selection and choices in diet and food consumption.Hammerstones and grinding stones of quartzite and sandstone are also found stered in large quantities.

Blade (archaeology) Wikipedia 2019104&ensp&#0183&enspIn archaeology,a blade is a type of stone tool created by striking a long narrow flake from a stone core.This process of reducing the stone and producing the blades is called lithic reduction.Archaeologists use this process of flintknapping to analyze blades and observe their technological uses for historical peoples.Blades are defined as Milling Definition of Milling at Dictionary Milling definition,an act or instance of subjecting something to the operation of a mill.See more.
