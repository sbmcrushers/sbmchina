Milling (machining) Milling is a cutting process that uses a milling cutter to remove material from the surface of a work piece.The milling cutter is a rotary cutting tool,often with multiple cutting points.As opposed to drilling,where the tool is advanced along its rotation axis,the cutter in milling is usually moved perpendicular to its axis so that cutting occurs on the circumference of the cutter. Horizontal boring machine A horizontal boring machine has its work spindle parallel to the ground and work table.Typically there are three linear axes in which the tool head and part move.Convention dictates that the main axis that drives the part towards the work spindle is the Z axis,with a cross traversing X axis and a vertically traversing Y axis.
