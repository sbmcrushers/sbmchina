sbm crushed granite fine used in civil engineeringIRJET International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology 1M.tech Scholar,Department of Civil Engineering,Institute of Technology Aisect University,Raisen (M.P.) India.the crushed granite with coconut shell aggregate can be economically used in reinforced concrete.3.CONCLUSIONS [2]From the above it's clear. Density of Aggregate Density is an important parameter for aggregate.For aggregates,density is determined by multiplying the relative density (specific gravity) of the aggregate times the density of water.Bulk Density of Aggregate [1]The bulk density or unit weight of an aggregate is the mass or weight of the aggregate that required to fill a container of a specified unit volume.
