Igneous rock Igneous rock is one of the three main rock types,the others being sedimentary and metamorphic rock.Igneous rocks are rocks formed from molten magma.The material is made liquid by the heat inside the Earth's mantle.When magma comes out onto the surface of the Earth,it is called lava.Lava cools down to form rocks such as tuff and basalt.
