Smelting Wikipedia Smelting is a process of applying heat to ore in order to extract a base metal.It is a form of extractive metallurgy.It is used to extract many metals from their ores,including silver,iron,copper,and other base metals.Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore,driving off other elements as gases or slag and leaving the metal base behind.
