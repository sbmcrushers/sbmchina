Particle Size Distribution an overview ScienceDirect, Aug 08,2011&#0183;&#32;Particle size distribution (PSD) is measured using a set of sieves stacked vertically with mesh sizes typically ranging from 100 mesh (150 microns) to 30 mesh (600 microns) A sample of material (typically 100 g) is shaken,vibrated,or tapped through the sieves for a fixed time period (typically 10 min) and the quantity retained on each sieve. 101 What is Particle Size Distribution D50,D50 Particle. You can treat particle size value as a mesh aperture size,all the particles smaller than such aperture falls down and pass through the mesh aperture,this is so called undersize,the particle size distribution is based on undersize.
