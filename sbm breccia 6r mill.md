Breccia Breccia Breccia is a rock formed from angular gravel and boulder sized clasts cemented together in a matrix.The angular nature of the clasts indicates that they have not been transported very far from their source.There are several modes of formation for breccia.Some represent consolidated material accumulated on steep hill Breccia (Como) Breccia fu abitata in et&#224; pre romana,forse addirittura dal I millennio a.C.Le scoperte archeologiche locali (la necropoli dell'et&#224; del Ferro in zona detta della &quot;Ca' Morta&quot;),riallacciano Breccia e la sua regione alla cosiddetta Cultura di Golasecca,mentre la &quot;Tomba del Carro&quot; (scoperta nel 1928) a quelle delle scoperte simili delle culture di Hallstatt e di La T&#232;ne.
