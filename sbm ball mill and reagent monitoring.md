During the last decade numerous protocols have been published using the method of ball milling for synthesis all over the field of organic chemistry.However,compared to other methods leaving their marks on the road to sustainable synthesis (e.g.microwave,ultrasound,ionic liquids) chemistry in ball mills IsaMill The IsaMill is a stirred medium grinding mill,in which the grinding medium and the ore being ground are stirred rather than being subjected to the tumbling action of older high throughput mills (such as ball mills and rod mills).Stirred mills often consist of stirrers mounted on a rotating shaft located along the central 5.2 Dissolved Oxygen and Biochemical Oxygen Demand. What is biochemical oxygen demand and why is it important? Biochemical oxygen demand,or BOD,measures the amount of oxygen consumed by microorganisms in decomposing organic matter in stream water.BOD also measures the chemical oxidation of inorganic matter (i.e.the extraction of oxygen from water via chemical reaction).
