Tension your belts at the speed of light! When the free span of a belt is plucked,tapped,or struck it will vibrate at a frequency known as its “natural” frequency.The frequency is a function of the static belt tension,the belt mass,and the length of the free belt span according to the following relationship: T = 0.0104 * K * L2 * F2 Where: T = static belt tension (lbs) Conveyor Belt Tension Calculations Second,additional tension must be added to the effective Belt Tension (Te) to prevent slippage on the drive pulley.This is called Slack Side Tension (Ts),or commonly called T2.Ts = D x Te; D = Drive factor (See Table B in Engineering Handbook).Next,the total tension To = Te + Ts. How to Calculate Pulley Systems Sciencing Calculate the tension in the rope using the following equation: T = M x A.Four example,if you are trying to find T in a basic pulley system with an attached mass of 9g accelerating upwards at 2m s&#178; then T = 9g x 2m s&#178; = 18gm s&#178; or 18N (newtons). How to measue synchronous (toothed) belt tension T st = static tension (N).f = vibration frequency (Hz) L = vibrating span length (m) m = belt mass per unit length and width (kg m 2).b = belt width (m) Belt tension can also be measured,or estimated,by causing the belt to deflect by a given amount (typically 1 64 inch per inch of belt span,or 0.4 mm per 25 mm of belt span) with a specified force.
