Study on wear of the grinding wheel with an abrasive. 1.Introduction.Grinding occupies certain proportion of the expenditures in all machining processes,stock and installation of machine tools.So it is necessary to assess the lifetime of grinding wheels.The wear of grinding wheel is an important indicator to assess the lifetime of grinding wheel,because high wear may lead to thermal damage or other unexpected defects of workpiece. Grinding with patterned grinding wheels The pattern size is directly influenced by the described process parameters.The frequency ratio (λ) between grinding wheel rotational frequency (n s) and tool rotational frequency (n tool) determines the number of patterns that is machined along the grinding wheel circumference.The tool trajectories of a single grinding wheel revolution with a frequency ratio of 8 and 32 are schematically. Rail Head Profile Grinding Machine What you get is a replicable grinding pattern with smooth and pointed facets.A guiding mechanism forces the rail guiding discs to turn with the pivoting grinding unit.This stops the machine from slipping while maintaining a constant grindstone contact pressure and creating a true copy of the rail head and its profile over a pivoting range.
