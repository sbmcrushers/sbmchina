What is the significance of ten percent fines value in. This test is very similar to Aggregate Crushing Test in which a standard force 400kN is applied and fines material expressed as a percentage of the original mass is the aggregate crushing value.Granular sub base is subjected to repeated loadings from truck types.The stress level at the contact points of aggregate particles is quite high. Aggregate Crushing Value Test Determine Aggregate. 5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Aggregate crushing value test on coarse aggregates gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate crushing under gradually applied compressive load.Coarse aggregate crushing value is the percentage by weight of the crushed material obtained when test aggregates are subjected to a specified load under standardized conditions. lab sheet fines value of aggregate lab sheet fines value of aggregate; Leave a Reply.January.One Thing: Aggregate Moisture Content Testing NPCA.&#183; By Kayla Hanson,Editor’s Note: This is the first article in a yearlong series that focuses in on the details and more technical aspects of one common thing precast concrete producers do on a daily basis.Ask.
