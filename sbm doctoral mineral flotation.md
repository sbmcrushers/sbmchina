Introduction to Mineral Processing froth flotation cells.The process of froth flotation entails crushing and grinding the ore to a fine size.This fine grinding separates the individual mineral particles from the waste rock and other mineral particles.The grinding is normally done in water with the resultant slurry called the pulp. A review of effects and appliions of ultrasound in During the flotation process,ultrafine clay or gangue minerals will adhere to the surface of valuable mineral,which is known as slime coating.The hydrophilic "armor" is formed on the mineral surface,and this deteriorated the adhesion behavior between particles and bubbles or flotation reagents [1].
