sbm jaw crusher reduce 15372P&amp;Q University Lesson 7 2 Sep 2019 The reduction ratio for a jaw crusher is typically 6 to 1,although it can be as high as 8 to 1.Jaw crushers can process shot rock and gravel. Jaw Crusher The gyratory crusher can,just like a jaw crusher,accept boulder sizes close to 1.5 m (for the largest equipment). This crusher can handle products with a Mohs hardness that is not necessarily less than 5. As is the case for jaw crushers,there is not any mutual sliding on grinding surfaces,but simply rolling of the nut on concaves. Crushing in Mineral Processing In mineral processing or metallurgy,the first stage of comminution is crushing.Depending of the type of rock (geometallurgy) to be crushed,there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks.In principle,compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wear resistant plate surface.Less abrasive and softer rocks or stones.
