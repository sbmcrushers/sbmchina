Back to Main Page.Strength of Cement Strength of cement is the most important of all the cement properties.Grades mentioned in the cement bags as 53 43 grade OPC Portland Cement Products Lehigh Hanson,Inc. Although natural cement dates back to the Romans,by the late 1800s builders were turning to its manufactured counterpart,portland cement,for higher strength and more consistent performance.English bricklayer Joseph Aspdin is widely credited for the invention of modern portland cement.Aspdin received the first patent on portland cement in 1824. Portland cement Specifiion 2006314&ensp&#0183&enspPortland cement shall be classified in accordance with the following types: Type I For use when the special properties specified for any other type are not required Type II For general use,more especially when moderate sulfate resistance or moderate heat of hydration is desired Type III For use when high early strength is desired HighStrength Concrete cement These materials impart additional strength to the concrete by reacting with portland cement hydration products to create additional CSH gel,the part of the paste responsible for concrete strength.It would be difficult to produce highstrength concrete mixtures without using chemical admixtures.
