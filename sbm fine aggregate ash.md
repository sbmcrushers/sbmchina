Effect of Fly Ash on Mortar Mixes with Quarry Dust as … In general,it was observed that fly ash exhibits very little cementing efficiency at the early ages and acts rather like fine aggregate (filler),but at later ages the pozzolanic property becomes effective leading to a considerable strength improvement. Concrete using agro waste as fine aggregate for. The Agricultural wastes used as fine aggregate in concrete are sugarcane bagasse ash,groundnut shell,oyster shell,sawdust,giant reed ash,rice husk ash,cork and tobacco waste.The major differences of these agro wastes are the place from where they collected and the processes to convert into a fine aggregate.
