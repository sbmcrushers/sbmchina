CDC NIOSH's Mining Program has a 40 year history of using a human factors systems approach to identify,characterize,mitigate,and respond to hazards,risks,and emergencies in the mining environment.This systems approach extends beyond the mineworker and includes others in the mining organization and beyond who can influence health and safety (H&S). Assessing the human immune system through blood. Blood is the pipeline of the immune system.Assessing changes in transcript abundance in blood on a genome wide scale affords a comprehensive view of the status of the immune system in health and disease.This review summarizes the work that has used this approach to identify therapeutic targets and biomarker signatures in the field of autoimmunity and infectious disease.
