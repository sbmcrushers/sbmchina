Hagen Poiseuille equation In nonideal fluid dynamics,the Hagen Poiseuille equation,also known as the Hagen Poiseuille law,Poiseuille law or Poiseuille equation,is a physical law that gives the pressure drop in an incompressible and Newtonian fluid in laminar flow flowing through a long cylindrical pipe of constant cross section.It can be successfully applied to air flow i Pulverizer — Wikipedia Republished WIKI 2 2019926&ensp&#0183&enspThe tube mill output (responding to boiler load demand) is controlled by regulating the primary airflow.This regulation,by sweeping pulverized fuel from the mill,is very fast comparable with oil firing response,but needs the coal level to be maintained in the mill. Carburetion The size of the main metering jet determines how much fuel can flow through.The fuel will now divide: Some will flow through the idle circuit and some through the main metering circuit.Idle Fuel Flow: The fuel flowing through the idle circuit will move up the idle tube to the top of the passage where it meets the first idle air bleed.

Cyclonic separation A cyclonic separation is a method of removing particulates from an air,gas or liquid stream,without the use of filters,through vortex separation.When removing particulate matter from liquid,a hydrocyclone is used; while from gas,a gas cyclone is used.Rotational effects and gravity are used to separate mixtures of solids and fluids.The method can also be used to separate fine droplets.
