What Is a Mixture in Chemistry? A mixture is what you get when you combine two substances in such a way that no chemical reaction occurs between the components,and you can separate them again.In a mixture,each component maintains its own chemical identity.Typically mechanical blending combines components of a mixture,although other processes may produce a mixture (e.g.diffusion,osmosis). extraction of metals 19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The treated ore is then put in a large bath of water containing a foaming agent (a soap or detergent of some kind),and air is blown through the mixture to make a lot of bubbles.Because they are water repellent,the coated particles of the metal compound tend to be picked up by the air bubbles,float to the top of the bath,and are allowed to.
