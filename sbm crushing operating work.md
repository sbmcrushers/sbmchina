Crusher Wikipedia Each crusher is designed to work with a certain maximum size of raw A cone crusher is suitable for crushing a variety of midhard and above midhard ores and What affects cone crusher performance? — Sandvik Mining The primary contributor to poor crusher performance is crushing chamber selection.If the fit between the mantle and concave in combination with the eccentric throw setting is incorrect,then the optimal reduction ratio cannot be achieved.Sandvik have found that the wrong crushing chamber setup can cause a loss in your reduction ratio Impact Crusher Working Principle 20191024&ensp&#0183&enspStarting from the base working principle that compression is the forcing of two surfaces towards one another to crush the material caught between them.Impact crushing can be of two variations: gravity and dynamic.An example of gravity impact would be dropping a rock onto a steel plate (similar to what goes on into an Autogenous Mill).
