Research Faculty Graduate Program of Hydrologic Sciences Meet the current hydrologic sciences' research Unsaturated zone hydrology,Dissertation dealt with arsenic transport in gold mine heap leach and waste rock Benefits of Computational Modeling for Geotechnical Gold HeapLeach Modeling.Itasca developed a numerical model to estimate gold (Au) production from heapleach operations.The objective was to simulate Au heap leaching using a model based on fluid flow and masstransport (hydrodynamic modeling) in a partially saturated pad,and quantitatively assess monthly production of goldcyanide production (AuCN). Appliion of Geoelectrical Tomography in Coupled Hydro A shortcoming of the heap leaching process is its inherent limited metal recovery rate,due primarily to preferential pathways,which reduces the efficiency of the leaching process and can decrease the stability of the heap structure.In this study,geophysical methods were used to characterize the heaps.
