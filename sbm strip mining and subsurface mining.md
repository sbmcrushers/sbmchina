Surface mining is a form of mining in which the soil and the rock covering the mineral deposits are removed.It is the other way of underground mining,in which the overlying rock is left behind,and the required mineral deposits are removed through shafts or tunnels.Surface mining is basically employed when deposits of commercially viable minerals or rock are found closer to the surface. Strip Mining: A Destructive Way of Coal Extraction. Strip mining also uses significant amount of water to suppress dust.Overall,the impact of coal mining in general on water is worth noting: it is not just the water used and depleted during the extraction process,but also the amount of water needed for converting coal into energy. Surface mining SURFACE MINING • Surface mining is done by removing (stripping) surface vegetation,dirt,and,if necessary,layers of bedrock in order to reach buried ore deposits (or) surface mining is the process of extraction of minerals by removal of overburden.• Overburden is the rock or waste material which is lying on the mineral to be owned. mining Flashcards Quizlet A power shovel cuts a series of terraces into the side of a hill.An earthmover removes the overburden,and a power shovel extracts the coal,with the overburden from each new terrace dumped onto the one below.Compare area strip mining,dredging,mountaintop removal,open pit mining,subsurface mining.
