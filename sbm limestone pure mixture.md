The chemistry of limestone: teacher&#39s notes The chemical and physical properties of limestone,especially when reasonably pure,make it highly sought after for hundreds of everyday uses.With salt and coal,it formed the main feedstock for the chemical industry until about 1914.It is still important today as shown by the wide range of uses in Tables 1 4 (Appendix). Choosing Between Liming Materials (A3671) limestone is made up of calcium carbonate,whereas,dolomitic limestone is a mixture of calcium and magnesium carbonate.Dolomitic limestone reacts somewhat more slowly with acid soils than does calcitic lime.However,as shown in figure 2,at the fineness to which agricultural limestone Is Chalk an Element,Compound or Mixture?
