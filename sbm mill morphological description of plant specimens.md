Morphological Investigation of Genus Ziziphus Mill. The genus Ziziphus Mill.is a member of the Family Rhamnaceae and comprises of ca.170 species distributed in tropical and subtropical regions.The species in the genus are of economic and medicinal importance.This study was conducted to identify the members of the genus in Saudi Arabia as well as morphological features that show delimitation in the genus. Cannabis The plant is also known as hemp,although this term is often used to refer only to varieties of Cannabis cultivated for non drug use.Cannabis has long been used for hemp fibre,hemp seeds and their oils,hemp leaves for use as vegetables and as juice,medicinal purposes,and as a recreational drug.

The plants investigated were collected in natural populations or grown from seeds.Quantitative data were analysed by several methods of statistics.The results obtained allow to extend anatomical and morphological descriptions of the studied species and to reveal their important diagnostic characters. Herbarium A herbarium (plural: herbaria) is a collection of preserved plant specimens and associated data used for scientific study.The specimens may be whole plants or plant parts; these will usually be in dried form mounted on a sheet of paper (called &quot;exsiccatae&quot;) but,depending upon the material,may also be stored in boxes or kept in alcohol or other preservative.
