sbm chemestry of cement pptHYDRATION OF CEMENT of cement except at early ages ( 3 days) and,when hardened cement paste is attacked by sulfates,expansion due to the formation of calcium sulfoaluminate from C3A may result in a disruption of the hardened paste.But it is useful in the cement industry. Types of Cement What are the different types of cement found in market? We have enlisted number of cement types and their uses in construction.In addition to ordinary cement,following are the other important types of cement: Acid resistant cement Blast furnace cement Coloured Composition of cement Composition of cement Introduction Portland cement gets its strength from chemical reactions between the cement and water.The process is known as hydration.This is a complex process that is best understood by first understanding the chemical composition of History of cement He called it Portland Cement because the concrete made from it looked like Portland stone,a widely used building stone in England.While history usually regards Aspdin as the inventor of Portland cement,Aspdin's cement was not produced at a high enough Properties of Cement Cement,a popular binding material,is a very important civil engineering material.This article concerns the physical and chemical properties of cement,as well as the methods to test cement properties.Please note that the information in Civiltoday.com is designed to.
