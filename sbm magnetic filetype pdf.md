MAGNETIC MARKETING SECRETS REVEALED PAGE 2 The beauty of Magnetic Marketing that I am going to share with you is that it totally eliminates cold calling.When I was a magician,what was being taught is that you had to get on the Magnet Guide &amp Tutorial B Magnetic induction,is the magnetic field induced by a field strength,H,at a given point.It is the vector sum,at each point within the substance,of the magnetic field strength and resultant intrinsic induction.Magnetic induction is the flux per unit area normal to the direction of the magnetic path. CHAPTER 17 MAGNETIC DIPOLE MOMENT UVic The SI unit for magnetic moment is clearly N m T−1.If an electric current I flows in a plane coil of area A (recall that area is a vector quantity hence the boldface),the torque it will experience in a magnetic field is given by τ= IA&#215B.17.2.2 This means that the magnetic moment Electric and Magnetic Forces MIT Electric and Magnetic Forces 28 dF &#181o 4 i2dl2&#215(i1dl1&#215ur) r2 (3.2) &#181o 4 &#21510 7 1.26&#21510 6 (V s A m).dF(1 2) &#181o 4 i1i2dl1dl2 r2 ur.can be neutralized by adding particles of oppositecharge sign,leaving only the effects of current.
