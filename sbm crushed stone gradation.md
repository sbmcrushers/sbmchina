TABLE OF CONTENTS * Only the gradation is required on the bag house fines.The gradation is done in accordance to Sieve Analysis of Mineral Filler for Bituminous Paving Mixtures,AASHTO T 37.Specific Gravity: Specific Gravity is the ratio of the mass of a given volume of aggregate to the mass of an equal volume of distilled water at the same temperature.

Aggregates for Concrete Civil Engineering Crushed stone is produced by crushing quarry rock,boulders,cobbles,or largesize gravel.Crushed aircooled blastfurnace slag is also used as fine or coarse aggregate.The aggregates are usually washed and graded at the pit or plant.Some variation in the type,quality,cleanliness,grading,moisture content,and other properties is expected. Specifiions For CRUSHED AGGREGATE BASE COARSE #2 &amp crushed gravel or crushed stone,fine aggregate and binder or filler blended as necessary to produce an intimate mixture of the required gradation and stability.Requirements: The aggregate shall consist of hard,durable particles of crushed stone or crushed gravel and a filler of natural sand,stone sand or other finely divided mineral matter. 5 Aggregate Specifiions and Requirements Gradation Requirements Fine Aggregates Coarse Aggregates B Borrow and Structure Backfill ASTM D 5821 is used to determine the crushed particle content.Crushed Type AS Aggregates Aggregates used for stone matrix asphalt mixtures are required to meet the requirements of AS aggregates in accordance with Section 904.03 (a). 6AA Limestone Edw.C.Levy Co. The 6AA Limestone should be blended into the concrete mixture along with the cement,fine aggregate,water,admixtures and any special additives in the proportions detailed in the mix design.Care needs to be taken to minimize the amount of handling of the 6AA Limestone as handling operations will cause 'dusting' of the aggregates particles SECTION 703 AGGREGATES consist of crushed stone free of vegetable matter and other del eterious substances.Neit her reclaim ed asphalt pavem ent (RAP) nor reclaim ed concr ete pavement will be allowed for untreated base.Crushing shall be regulated so that at l east 80 percent,by weight,of materi al New Enterprise Stone &amp Lime Co.Inc.
