Red mud is a byproduct of aluminum production,in which alumina is extracted from bauxite ore via the Bayer process Continue Reading The Chemistry and Processing of Jamaican Bauxite The first commercial extraction of alumina (Al 2 O 3) from bauxite has been attributed to Henri Sainte Claire Deville in about 1854 Soon after this,in 1888,Karl Joseph Bayer described what is now known as the Bayer Process,which led to a dramatic reduction in the cost of aluminum metal
